# How can this project be useful for early stage Startups?

- **Low cost:** - open-source tools only
- **Baseline security:** - deny-by-default and blocks common attack ports
- **Visibility:** - simple plain-English summaries that anyone can read
- **Automation:** - anomaly detection to surface scans/brute-force early on
- **Initial Stage:** - builds security habits without slowing delivery

*Not a SIEM replacement but rather a practical starting point that improves resilience quickly.*
